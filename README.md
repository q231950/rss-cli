# rss-cli
A command line interface to open RSS feed items in a browser

# Usage
In order to start reading, you should run the following on a OS X machine
`ruby ./lib/reader.rb read`
This will create a _.rss_reader_config.yml_ in your home folder in case there is none already. You can add/edit feeds in that config file.
